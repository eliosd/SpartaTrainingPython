Pillars of OOP

1. Abstraction - hide the complicated stuff
2. Encapsulation -
3. Inheritance - use methods from other classes
4. Polymorphism - [Python - method overiding] use and modify classes to fit other classes [Other languages (method overloading - methods can take different forms)]



SOLID Principles

S- Single responsibility
O- Open for extension, closed for modification
